This is going to be my first project in Javascript.
It is about the grade-school game "Rock, Paper and Scissor".

These are the possible outcomes for the game:

1. X beats Y
2. Y beats Z
3. Z beats X
4. X draw X
5. Y draw Y
6. Z draw Z

Pseudocode:

1. create a function to make a pick for the computer
2. implement an algorithm to decide a winner
3. give back a text when win/lose/draw
4. create a function to count the score of each player
5. create a function to simulate a round of rock, paper & scissor
